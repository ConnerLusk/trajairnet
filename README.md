![ha](images/Fig1v4.pdf)

Pilots  operating  aircraft  in  un-towered  airspacerely  on  their  situational  awareness  and  prior  knowledge  topredict the future trajectories of other agents. These predictionsare conditioned on the past trajectories of other agents, agent-agent  social  interactions  and  environmental  context  such  as airport  location  and  weather.  This  paper  provides  a  dataset, TrajAir, that captures this behaviour in a non-towered terminal airspace around a regional airport. We also present a baseline socially-aware trajectory prediction algorithm, TrajAirNet, that uses  the  dataset  to  predict  the  trajectories  of  all  agents.  The dataset  is  collected  for  111  days  over  8  months  and  contains ADS-B transponder data along with the corresponding METAR weather data. The data is processed to be used as a benchmark with  other  publicly  available  social  navigation  datasets.  To the  best  of  authorsâ€™  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  3D  social aerial  navigation  dataset  thus  introducing  social  navigationfor  autonomous  aviation.TrajAirNet combines  state-of-the-artmodules  in  social  navigation  to  provide  predictions  in  a  static environment with a dynamic context. 

## Installation

### Environment Setup

First, we'll create a conda environment to hold the dependencies.

```
conda create --name trajairnet --file requirements.txt
conda activate trajairnet
```

### Data Setup

The network uses [TrajAir Dataset](https://theairlab.org/trajair/).

```
cd dataset
wget https://kilthub.cmu.edu/ndownloader/articles/14866251/versions/1
```

Unzip files as required.

##  Model Training

For training data we can choose between the 4 subsets of data labelled 7days1, 7days1, 7days1, 7days1 or the entire dataset 111_days. For example, to train with 7days1 use:  

`python train.py --dataset_name 7days1`

Training will use GPUs if available.

##  Model Testing

For training data we can choose between the 4 subsets of data labelled 7days1, 7days1, 7days1, 7days1 or the entire dataset 111_days. For example, to test with 7days1 use:  

`python test.py --dataset_name 7days1`

## TrajAir Dataset processing

This repository also contains untilities to process raw data from TrajAir dataset to produce the processed outputs. 

`python adsb_preprocess/process.py --dataset_name 7days1`
